# Bamazon-cli-App
In this activity, I'll be creating an Amazon-like storefront using MySQL. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory.


## How to use

 At the start, the app will ask you what item you'd like to buy. Enter the number that corresponds to the desired product. 

Once you have selected the product, the app will ask for the quantity of said item. Input the desired amount.

If there is enough inventory to fulfil your order, your order will be processed.

However, if there is not enough inventory, your order will be canceled instead.
